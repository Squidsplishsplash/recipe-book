# recipe-book
Odin Project 1

This is a project to test my fundamental knowledge of HTML.  I will code a small site with
a few recipes using the html boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, images, text links,
ordered and unordered lists.  I will practise commiting and pushing my changes to git hub
along the way.

This was a great place to start and I'm excited to play with this project again after
learning CSS and Javascript!
