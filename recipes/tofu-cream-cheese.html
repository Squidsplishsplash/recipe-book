        <p>
            This creamy vegan cream cheese is easy to make and requires only 7 simple ingredients.  The base is delicious alone, but you can experiment and customize how you like!
            Mix in scallions, shredded carrots, and fresh herbs for a savory vegan spread.
            Alternatively, sweeten it up by incorporating raisins, cinnamon, and walnuts.

        <p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>14 oz block Firm Tofu</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Nutritional Yeast</li>
            <li>1 large Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Vegan Butter melted</li>
            <li>0.5-1 tsp Sea Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the water from the package of tofuâ€” don't press it.</li>
            <li>Add the firm tofu to a blender or food processor along with the remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Blend until smooth and creamy. A food processor may not blend as smooth as a blender; it might be a little grainy but it will still taste great.</li>
            <li>Pour into a container or bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour before serving, if possible. The butter will harden and the texture will become smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add any additional flavors and serve as desired! Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
