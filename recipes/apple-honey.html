        <h3>Try this easy 3-ingredient bee-less honey üå∏üêù</h3>
        <p>Like it's honey cousin, this simple apple honey is a sweet and fragrant delight! You can use this vegan honey as a replacement for any recipe or dish you would typically use honey! This recipe is a fantastic substitute because, like I previously mentioned, it looks, feels, and tastes nearly just like the real thing. I like to add mine to hot tea, on peanut butter and banana toast, over yogurt parfaits, and even in savory dishes, just to name a few. I love keeping a jar of this in my fridge at all times because it takes almost no effort to make, is super convenient, and lasts a long while!</p>
        <p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups filtered apple juice</li>
            <li>2 cups organic cane sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>(optional herbs or teas) lavender, rose, chamomile, and/or orange zest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bee honey can vary in flavor depending on the type you get. It can taste fruity or have floral undertones. It all depends on what the worker bees are pollinating. The base of this recipe only needs 3 ingredients, but you can steep in these optional floral or fruity notes using teas, herbs, flowers, and extracts.</p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all of the ingredients into a medium-sized saucepot, place it over high heat, and bring it up to a boil, constantly stirring to dissolve the sugar and prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>As SOON as it is at a steady boil, turn the heat down to medium/medium-high and cook it at a medium and steady boil for 35 minutes. Remove any teabags if they were used. If the liquid bubbles to the top of the pot and looks like it may boil over, turn the heat down ever so slightly. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>After 35 minutes, the liquid should have been reduced by half, yielding roughly 2 cups of vegan honey. If not, cook it for a tad longer; otherwise, it will not be thick enough- but keep in mind it will look somewhat loose right now but will be much thicker once it is cold!</li>
            <li>Remove it from the heat and let it cool down slightly at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Lastly, pour the vegan honey into a glass jar and store it in the refrigerator. Use a fine strainer or cheesecloth if your honey includes herbal sediment</li>
            <li>*If the vegan honey is not the desired thickness after cooling, simply reheat it over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and cook a tad longer while stirring frequently to prevent burning and overboiling until the desired thickness is achieved.</li>
        </ol>
